# Workflow description

As seen in the Installation and Running section you can run nucleo QC using two was:

1. In a two-step process by running nucleo\_qc\__generator.cwl (Figure 1) to generate the QC files followed by nucleo\_aggregate\__visualize.cwl (Figure 2) to aggregate all QC metrics for each BAM files and produce the MultiQC report.

Figure 1 depicts diagramatically the nucleo\_qc\__generator.cwl workflow. The cwl consists of subworkflows specific to each BAM file generated by nucleo, collapsed, uncollapsed, duplex and simplex. This cwl generates the regular QC files and the coverage report._

Figure 2 depicts the qc aggregator workflow that aggregates the qc files generated by the qc\_generator step and created the MultiQC report.

2\. To generate all the QC files in a single step run the main workflow nucleo\_qc.cwl (Figure 3). This workflow is made up of the two previous subworkflows seen in Figure 1 and 2.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Use the second method by running nucleo\_qc.cwl. You can always generate single sample multiQC reports by running nucleo\__aggregate\_visualize.cwl on the sample QC folders produced by nucleo\_qc.cwl._
