# Contamination

## Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

Two metrics are used to estimate sample contamination: minor contamination and major contamination. Moreover, minor contamination is calculated separately for collapsed and duplex BAMs. Both contamination metrics are produced by the fingerprinting SNP set. However, minor contamination is calculated using just the homozygous sites, whereas the major contamination is via the ratio of heterozygous to homozygous sites. For each contamination-BAM type combination there is a table showing per-sample contamination values and any associated metrics.\
